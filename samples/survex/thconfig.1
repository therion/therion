#! not all stations are replaced correctly. The "created" series

#! This is because in top level import command, survey <em>create</em> is
#! imported from file <code>create/create.3d</code> with wrong coordinates,
#! and we import top-level .3d file with <code>-surveys use</code> switch.
#! This means, cave.create.1 will be imported here as create.1@cave and not
#! 1@create.cave.
#!
#! To solve this problem, we need to re-import stations
#! from top-level cave.3d file once more with <code>-surveys create</code>
#! switch.
